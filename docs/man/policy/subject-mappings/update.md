Update a Subject Mapping to alter entitlement of an entity to an Attribute Value.

`Actions` are updated in place, destructively replacing the current set. If you want to add or remove actions, you must provide the full set of actions on update.

At this time, creation of a new SCS during update of a subject mapping is not supported.

For more information about subject mappings, see the `subject-mappings` subcommand.

For more information about subject condition sets, see the `subject-condition-sets` subcommand.

## Example

```shell
otdfctl policy subject-mappings update --id 39866dd2-368b-41f6-b292-b4b68c01888b --action-standard DECRYPT,TRANSMIT
