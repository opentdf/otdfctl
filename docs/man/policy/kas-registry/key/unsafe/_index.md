Unsafe changes are dangerous mutations to KAS that can significantly change access behavior around existing keys
and entitlement.

Depending on the unsafe change introduced and already existing TDFs, TDFs might become inaccessible that were previously
accessible or vice versa.

Make sure you know what you are doing.

For more general information about keys, see the `kas-keys` subcommand.
