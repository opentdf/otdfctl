The Key Access Server (KAS) registry is a record of servers granting and maintaining public keys.
The registry contains critical information like each server's uri, its public key (which can be
either local or at a remote uri), and any metadata about the server. Key Access Servers grant keys
for specified Attributes and their Values via Attribute Key Access Grants and Attribute Value Key
Access Grants.
