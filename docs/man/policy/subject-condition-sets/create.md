### Example Subject Condition Sets

`--subject-sets` example input:

```json
[
  {
    "condition_groups": [
      {
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": 1,
            "subject_external_values": ["CoolTool", "RadService", "ShinyThing"],
            "subject_external_selector_value": ".team.name"
          },
          {
            "operator": 2,
            "subject_external_values": ["marketing"],
            "subject_external_selector_value": ".org.name"
          }
        ],
        "boolean_operator": 1
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

ConditionGroup `boolean_operator` is driven through the API `CONDITION_BOOLEAN_TYPE_ENUM` definition:

| CONDITION_BOOLEAN_TYPE_ENUM | index value | comparison            |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| AND                         | 1           | all conditions met    |
| OR                          | 2           | any one condition met |

Condition `operator` is driven through the API `SUBJECT_MAPPING_OPERATOR_ENUM` definition,
and is evaluated by applying the `subject_external_selector_value` to the Subject entity
representation (token or Entity Resolution Service response) and comparing the logical operator
against the list of `subject_external_values`:

| SUBJECT_MAPPING_OPERATOR_ENUM | index value | subject value at selector MUST |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| IN                            | 1           | be any of the values           |
| NOT_IN                        | 2           | not be any of the values       |
| IN_CONTAINS                   | 3           | contain one of the values      |

In the example SCS above, the Subject entity MUST BE represented with a token claim or ERS response
containing a field at `.team.name` identifying them as team name "CoolTool", "RadService", or "ShinyThing", AND THEY MUST ALSO have a field `org.name` that is NOT "marketing".

This structure if their team name was "CoolTool" and they were entitled might look like:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "name": "CoolTool" // could alternatively be RadService or ShinyThing
  },
  "org": {
    "name": "sales"
  }
}
```

If any condition in the group is not met (such as if `.org.name` were `marketing` instead),
the condition set would not resolve to true, and the Subject would not be found to be entitled
to the Attribute Value applicable to this Subject Condition Set via Subject Mapping between.
