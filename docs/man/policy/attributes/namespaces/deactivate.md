Deactivating an Attribute Namespace will make the namespace name inactive as well as any attribute definitions and values beneath.

Deactivation of a Namespace renders any existing TDFs of those attributes inaccessible.

Deactivation will permanently reserve the Namespace name within a platform. Reactivation and deletion are both considered "unsafe"
behaviors.

For reactivation, see the `unsafe` command.
