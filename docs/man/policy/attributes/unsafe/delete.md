# Unsafe Delete Warning

Deleting an Attribute Definition cascades deletion of any Attribute Values and any associated mappings underneath.

Any existing TDFs containing the deleted attribute of this name will be rendered inaccessible until it has been recreated.

Make sure you know what you are doing.

For more general information about attributes, see the `attributes` subcommand.
