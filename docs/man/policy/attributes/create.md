Under a namespace, create an attribute with a rule. An attribute definition `name` is normalized to lower case
and may contain hyphens and underscores between other alphanumeric characters.

### Rules

#### ANY_OF

If an Attribute is defined with logical rule `ANY_OF`, an Entity who is mapped to `any` of the associated Values of the Attribute
on TDF'd Resource Data will be Entitled.

#### ALL_OF

If an Attribute is defined with logical rule `ALL_OF`, an Entity must be mapped to `all` of the associated Values of the Attribute
on TDF'd Resource Data to be Entitled.

### HIERARCHY

If an Attribute is defined with logical rule `HIERARCHY`, an Entity must be mapped to the same level Value or a level above in hierarchy
compared to a given Value on TDF'd Resource Data. Hierarchical values are considered highest at index 0 and lowest at the last index.

For more general information about attributes, see the `attributes` subcommand.

## Example

```shell
otdfctl policy attributes create --namespace 3d25d33e-2469-4990-a9ed-fdd13ce74436 --name myattribute --rule ANY_OF
```
