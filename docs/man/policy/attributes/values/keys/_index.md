The `keys` command allows management of public keys associated with an attribute value. These keys are then used during the encryption operation to wrap individual key splits when creating a new TDF(Trusted Data Format).

For more information on how key splitting work, see the [OpenTDF Documentation](https://opentdf.io/components/policy/key_access_grants).
