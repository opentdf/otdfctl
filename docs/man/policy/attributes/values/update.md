Attribute Value changes can be dangerous, so this command is for updates considered "safe" (currently just mutations to metadata `labels`).

For unsafe updates, see the dedicated `unsafe update` command. For more general information, see the `values` subcommand.

For more general information about attributes, see the `attributes` subcommand.
