Removes a Custom Action from platform Policy. Standard Actions cannot be deleted.

Action deletion cascades to entitlement Subject Mappings, Obligations, and Registered
Resource entitlement requirements.

Make sure you know what you are doing.

For more information about Actions, see the manual for the `actions` subcommand.

## Example 

```shell
otdfctl policy actions delete --id 217b300a-47f9-4bee-be8c-d38c880053f7
```
