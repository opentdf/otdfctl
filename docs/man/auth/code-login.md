Authenticate for use of the OpenTDF Platform through a browser (required).

Provide a specific public 'client-id' known to support the Auth Code PKCE flow and recognized
by the OpenTDF Platform, or use the default public client in the platform well-known configuration if not specified.

The OIDC Access Token will be stored in the OS-specific keychain by default, otherwise printed to `stdout` if `--no-cache` is passed.
