# otdfctl: cli to manage OpenTDF Platform

This command line interface is used to manage OpenTDF Platform.

The main goals are to:

- simplify setup
- facilitate migration
- aid in configuration management

## TODO list

- [ ] Add support for json input as piped input
- [ ] Add help level handler for each command
- [ ] Add support for `--verbose` persistent flag
- [ ] Helper functions to support common tasks like pretty printing and json output

## Usage

The CLI is configured via profiles. Use `otdfctl profile create <name> <endpoint>` (and optionally `--set-default`) to define how the CLI should connect to your platform instance.

Load up the platform (see its [README](https://github.com/opentdf/platform?tab=readme-ov-file#run) for instructions).

## Development

### CLI

The CLI is built using [cobra](https://cobra.dev/).

The primary function is to support CRUD operations using commands as arguments and flags as the values.

The output format (currently `styled` or `json`) is stored with each profile (via `otdfctl profile create --output-format <styled|json>` or `otdfctl profile set-output-format <profile> <styled|json>`) and can still be overridden per command with the `--json` flag.

#### To add a command

1. Capture the flag value and validate the values
   1. Alt support JSON input as piped input
2. Run the handler which is located in `pkg/handlers` and pass the values as arguments
3. Handle any errors and return the result in a lite TUI format

For a detailed example of adding a new subcommand (including arguments, flags, and documentation), see [`docs/example-add-subcommand.md`](docs/example-add-subcommand.md).

### TUI

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a work in progress please avoid touching until framework is defined

The TUI will be used to create an interactive experience for the user.

## Documentation

Documentation drives the CLI in this project. This can be found in `/docs/man` and is used in the
CLI via the `man.Docs.GetDoc()` function.

## Documentation-Driven CLI

The CLI help system and usage output are powered by Markdown documentation in `docs/man/`. When adding or changing commands or flags, always update the corresponding Markdown file. The documentation is parsed at runtime and also published to the OpenTDF docs website.

To ensure documentation and code remain in sync:
- Update the relevant Markdown doc in `docs/man/` when you add or change a command.
- Review the CLI help output after changes.
- See `CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md` for more details.

## Testing

The CLI is equipped with a test mode that can be enabled by building the CLI with `config.TestMode = true`.
For convenience, the CLI can be built with `make build-test`.

**Test Mode features**:

- Use the in-memory keyring provider for user profiles
- Enable provisioning profiles for testing via `OTDFCTL_TEST_PROFILE` environment variable

### BATS

> [!NOTE]
> Bat Automated Test System (bats) is a TAP-compliant testing framework for Bash. It provides a simple way to verify that the UNIX programs you write behave as expected.

BATS is used to test the CLI from an end-to-end perspective. To run the tests you will need to ensure the following
prerequisites are met:

- bats is installed on your system
  - Follow bats-core advice [here](https://github.com/bats-core/homebrew-bats-core?tab=readme-ov-file#homebrew-bats-core)
- The platform is running and provisioned with basic keycloak clients/users
  - See the [platform README](https://github.com/opentdf/platform) for instructions

To run the tests you can either run `make test-bats` or execute specific test suites with `bats e2e/<test>.bats`.

#### Terminal Size

Some tests for output rendered in the terminal will vary in behavior depending on terminal size.

Terminal size when testing:

1. set to standard defaults if running `make test-bats`
2. can be set manually by mouse in terminal where tests are triggered
3. can be set by argument `./e2e/resize_terminal.sh < rows height > < columns width >`
4. can be set by environment variable, i.e. `export TEST_TERMINAL_WIDTH="200"` (200 is columns width)

#### TestRail Integration (Optional)

This project supports optional integration with TestRail for uploading BATS test results.

##### 1. Prerequisites

- TestRail account with API access enabled
- `jq`, `curl` installed

##### 2. Setup

1. Copy and configure TestRail connection: 
`cp testrail.config.example.json testrail.config.json`

  Edit `testrail.config.json` with:
  - `url`: Your TestRail instance URL
  - `projectId`: Your TestRail project ID 
  - `tapFile`: Path to BATS TAP results file 

2. Copy and configure test mapping:
  `cp testname-to-testrail-id.example.json testname-to-testrail-id.json`

Fill in the mapping between test names (exactly as they appear in TAP output) and your TestRail case IDs.
Can be flat JSON:
```json
{
  "test_name_1": "C12345",
  "test_name_2": "C67890"
}
```
Or nested for better organization:
```json
{
  "group_1": {
    "test_name_1": "C12345",
    "test_name_2": "C67890"
  },
  "group_2": {
    "test_name_3": "C54321"
  }
}
```

3. Set TestRail credentials via environment variables
```bash
   export TESTRAIL_USER=you@example.com
   export TESTRAIL_PASS=your_api_key
```

##### 3. Run Tests and Upload Results

1. Run BATS with TAP report output (e2e folder): `bats --tap bats-tests/ > e2e/bats-results.tap`
Alternatively, get the TAP test report from the CI pipeline artifacts.
2. Upload results to TestRail:
`TESTRAIL_CLI_RUN_NAME=*optional-testrail-run-name* ./testrail-integration/upload-bats-test-results-to-testrail.sh`
